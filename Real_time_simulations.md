A powerful tool for real-time observation of our simulations is the ```gnuplot``` software (available for both Window and Linux). An elegant way of integrating this software with python can be achieved through the ```subprocess module```. Before going into simulation topics, let's see some examples of how we can call ```gnuplot``` from our ```python``` code.
